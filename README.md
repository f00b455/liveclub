## Three js Video Chat

This is a simple example of rendering a local and remote video stream in a three dimensional environment using WebRTC, Node.js, Socket.io and Three.js.
This example is put together using Hiren Kavad's PeerChat and Lee Stemkoski's Three.js Webcam-Texture example. PeerChat has been modified to also work with Mozilla Firefox
